## Android App Documentation: User Authentication and Data Retrieval 

1. **Introduction:** This Android app, developed in Android Studio using Java, XML, and Volley, facilitates user authentication by taking input (mobile number, password), fetching data from a MySQL database on XAMPP, matching credentials, and redirecting to a new activity upon verification.

2. **Prerequisites:** Ensure Android Studio, XAMPP, and basic Android development knowledge are installed.

3. **Setup:** Install XAMPP, create a database ("membershipApp"), and design a table ("login") in phpMyAdmin for storing user credentials.

4. **Volley Library:** Add Volley dependency in `build.gradle` for efficient data transmission.

5. **UI Design:** Design `activity_main.xml` with EditText fields for user input and a Button to initiate the authentication process.

6. **User Input Handling:** In `MainActivity.java`, retrieve and validate user input.

7. **Fetching Data:** Use Volley to send a POST request to a PHP script on the server to fetch user data based on the entered mobile number.

8. **Server-Side Scripting (Fetch):** Develop a PHP script to retrieve user data from the MySQL database based on the provided mobile number.

9. **Authentication:** Compare the entered password with the fetched data. If matched, proceed to a new activity; otherwise, display an error message.

10. **New Activity:** Create a new activity in Android Studio (`DashboardActivity.java`), which will be launched upon successful authentication.

11. **Data Passing:** Pass relevant user data to the new activity using Intent extras.

12. **Testing:** Run the app, enter valid credentials, and verify the successful transition to the new activity upon authentication.

13. **Conclusion:** Congratulations on implementing user authentication and data retrieval in your Android app!
